~Union Shop~
2nd Year Computer Science Coursework:

Project description:
This is a flutter application that I have been adding to for my coursework. My goal is to demonstrate my knowledge of flutter development by creating a 'website' that you can navigate around and has widgets you can interact with.
It represents a fictional student union shop where users can look at different university merchandise.
